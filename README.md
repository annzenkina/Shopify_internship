# Shopify_internship
The purpose was to compare fans activity in twitter of four hockey teams during Stenley Cup Competition.
I got tweets with team mentions during three days of the last match and filtered them by team's original city.
Also I wanted to count those tweets and tweets with the same location for the same period of time but without mentions of teams.
The idea was to show fans of which team are the most active.

I couldn't finish this project, because it is impossible to count so many tweets using twitter's API.
